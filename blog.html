        <h1>Circus Freak is a Compliment</h1>

        <p>I wouldn't have imagined that circus training would completely change how I view myself and others, but it has been the biggest blessing in my life.</p>

        <p>Some of the best benefits of circus training have been:</p>
            <div class="emphasize">
            <ul>
                <li>Sense of self worth</li>
                <li>Better self esteem</li>
                <li>Stronger body</li>
                <li>Healthier lifestyle</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

        <p>One of the first things you develop as a circus artist is your grip strength, both in vertical and horizontal orientations. This can be done on silks (fabric, tissu) and trapeze.</p>
